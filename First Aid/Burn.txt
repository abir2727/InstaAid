Get the person away from the heat source to stop the burning.
Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes.
Don't use ice, iced water, or any creams or greasy substances such as butter.
Remove any clothing or jewellery that's near the burnt area of skin, including babies' nappies - but don't move anything that's stuck to the skin.
Make sure the person keeps warm by using a blanket, for example, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area.
Cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it. A clean plastic bag could also be used for burns on your hand.
Use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain.
If the face or eyes are burnt, sit up as much as possible, rather than lying down .This helps to reduce swelling.
