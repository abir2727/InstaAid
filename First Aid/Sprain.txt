Rest the injured limb.
Your doctor may recommend not putting any weight on the injured area for 48 to 72 hours, so you may need to use crutches.
A splint or brace also may be helpful initially.
But don't avoid all activity.
Even with an ankle sprain, you can usually still exercise other muscles to minimize deconditioning.
Ice the area.
Use a cold pack, a slush bath or a compression sleeve filled with cold water to help limit swelling after an injury.
Try to ice the area as soon as possible after the injury.
Continue to ice it for 15 to 20 minutes, four to eight times a day, for the first 48 hours or until swelling improves.
If you use ice, be careful not to use it too long, as this could cause tissue damage.
Compress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage.
Compressive wraps or sleeves made from elastic or neoprene are best.
Elevate the injured limb above your heart whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling.
