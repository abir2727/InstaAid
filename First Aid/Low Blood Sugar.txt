Help them sit down.
If they have their own glucose gel, help them take it.
If not, you need to give them something sugary like fruit juice, a fizzy drink, three teaspoons of sugar, or sugary sweets.
If they improve quickly, give them more sugary food or drink and let them rest.
If they have their glucose testing kit with them, help them use it to check their glucose level.
Stay with them until they feel completely better.
If they do not improve quickly, look for any other causes and then call 999 or 112 for medical help.
While waiting, keep checking their responsiveness, breathing and pulse.
