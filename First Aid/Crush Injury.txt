Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure.
Cover the area with a wet cloth or bandage.
Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible.
If there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area.
Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice.
