Ask the person if he or she is carrying an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) to treat an allergic attack.
If the person says he or she needs to use an autoinjector, ask whether you should help inject the medication.
Have the person lie still on his or her back.
Loosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket.
Do not give the person anything to drink.
If there is vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn the person on his or her side to prevent choking.
If there are no signs of breathing, coughing or movement, begin CPR.
Do uninterrupted chest presses about 100 every minute until paramedics arrive.
Get emergency treatment even if symptoms start to improve.
After anaphylaxis, it is possible for symptoms to recur.
Monitoring in a hospital for several hours is usually necessary.
