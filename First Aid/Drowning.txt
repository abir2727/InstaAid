Rescue breathing can begin in the water, but all other care requires that the victim be safely out of the water.
If other people are available, send person to get help and call 911.
Send another person to get an automated external defibrillator (AED).
If the victim is breathing,he or she should be placed on their side in the recovery position to prevent potential aspiration should vomiting occur (inhaling vomit into the lung).
If the victim is not breathing and has no pulse, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
