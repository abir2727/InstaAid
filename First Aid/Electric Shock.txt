Turn off the source of electricity, if possible.
If not, move the source away from you and the person, using a dry, nonconducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood.
Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.
Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled.
Apply a bandage. Cover any burned areas with a sterile gauze bandage, if available, or a clean cloth.
Don't use a blanket or towel, because loose fibers can stick to the burns.
