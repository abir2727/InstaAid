Use more salt. For people with low blood pressure, that can be a good thing.
But because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, it's important to check with your doctor before increasing the salt in your diet.
Drink more water. Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension.
Wear compression stockings. The elastic stockings commonly used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins can help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs.
Several medications can be used to treat low blood pressure, for example, the drug fludrocortisone.
